1.To install the mods go to http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html and download the latest version of forge*1 also for your operating system for me it is windows.
 2.After downloading you should get a (.jar) executable file which you left click on and press Open with... and select (JavaTM platform Se Binary) after that it will say what you have to do to install it. 
 3.After you have forge installed downlaod the .zip from this github page.
 4.Now that you have the (.zip) in your downloads folder put in on your desktop and left click it and extract all. 
 5.Your (.zip) should now be a normal folder if so you should press (the windows key+r) then a window titled "run" should pop up in there  paste (%appdata%/.minecraft) without the brackets that should lead you to your minecraft folder.
 6.In the minecraft folder look for a folder called "mods" if you find it put the files from the folder on your desktop in there. Btw i'm aware i am saying folder alot.
 7.At that point you are done have dun with the mods
